// A wanderer lives in a remote landscape with three villages: Avalon, Belthar and Cresthaven. Every morning, they leave
// the village they are in and travel to one of the other two villages, choosing between the two destinations at random
// with an equal 50â€“50 chance. If the wanderer begins in their home village of Avalon and stops after 100 days of
// travel, are they more likely to end up in Avalon or in Belthar? Or are both destinations equally likely?


// Gemini answer:
// The Logic Behind the Puzzle ðŸ¤”
// 
// Let Pnâ€‹(A) be the probability that the wanderer is in Avalon on day n.
//     On Day 0, the wanderer is in Avalon, so P0â€‹(A)=1.
//     On Day 1, they must leave Avalon, so P1â€‹(A)=0.
//     On Day 2, they can return to Avalon from either Belthar or Cresthaven. The probability of doing so is P2â€‹(A)=0.5.
// 
// To be in Avalon on any given day, the wanderer must have been in Belthar or Cresthaven the day before. The total
// probability of being in Belthar or Cresthaven is simply 1âˆ’Pnâ€‹(A). Since the choice is always 50/50, the probability
// of returning to Avalon is half of that.
// 
// This gives us the recurrence relation: Pn+1â€‹(A) = (1âˆ’Pnâ€‹(A)â€‹)/2
// 
// This formula shows that the probability of being in Avalon oscillates around the equilibrium state of 1/3.
//     For even days (like Day 100), the probability Pnâ€‹(A) is always slightly greater than 1/3.
//     For odd days, the probability Pnâ€‹(A) is always slightly less than 1/3.
// 
// Since the remaining probability is split evenly between Belthar and Cresthaven, their individual probabilities will
// be slightly less than 1/3 on an even day. Therefore, on Day 100, the wanderer is most likely to be in Avalon.
