⌊Warnings report⌋
•  ¬Empty files
•  ¬Source text files (based on extension) that should contain text, but with unrecognized content
•  ¬UTF-8 files with BOM
•  ¬UTF-16 files without BOM
•  ¬Different encodings for a given file type (extension) in a folder
•  ¬Mixed EOL styles in a file
•  ¬Different EOL styles for a given file type (extension) in a folder

Counts include with and without BOM variants.
8-bit text files are likely Windows 1252/Latin-1/ANSI or OEM 850/OEM 437, there is no detailed analysis.

⌊EOL Styles⌋
-  ¬⟪Windows⟫: \\r\\n
-  ¬⟪Unix⟫: \\n
-  ¬⟪Mac⟫: \\r

⌊Glob pattern rules⌋
•  ¬⟦?⟧ matches any single character.
•  ¬⟦*⟧ matches any (possibly empty) sequence of characters.
•  ¬⟦**⟧ matches the current directory and arbitrary subdirectories. To match files in arbitrary subdirectories, use ⟦**\\*⟧. This sequence must form a single path component, so both **a and b** are invalid and will result in an error.
•  ¬⟦[...]⟧ matches any character inside the brackets. Character sequences can also specify ranges of characters, as ordered by Unicode, so e.g. ⟦[0-9]⟧ specifies any character between 0 and 9 inclusive. Special cases: ⟦[[]⟧ represents an opening bracket, ⟦[]]⟧ represents a closing bracket. 
•  ¬⟦[!...]⟧ is the negation of ⟦[...]⟧, i.e. it matches any characters not in the brackets.
•  ¬The metacharacters ⟦?⟧, ⟦*⟧, ⟦[⟧, ⟦]⟧ can be matched by using brackets (e.g. ⟦[?]⟧). When a ⟦]⟧ occurs immediately following ⟦[⟧ or ⟦[!⟧ then it is interpreted as being part of, rather then ending, the character set, so ⟦]⟧ and NOT ⟦]⟧ can be matched by ⟦[]]⟧ and ⟦[!]]⟧ respectively. The ⟦-⟧ character can be specified inside a character sequence pattern by placing it at the start or the end, e.g. ⟦[abc-]⟧.
•  ¬⟦{choice1,choice2...}⟧  match any of the comma-separated choices between braces. Can be nested, and include ⟦?⟧, ⟦*⟧ and character classes.
•  ¬Character classes ⟦[ ]⟧ accept regex syntax such as ⟦[\\d]⟧ to match a single digit, see https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#character-classes for character classes and escape sequences supported.

⌊Autorecurse glob pattern transformation⌋
•  ¬⟪Constant pattern (no filter, no **⟧) pointing to a folder⟫: ⟦\\**\\*⟧ is appended at the end to search all files of all subfolders.
•  ¬⟪Patterns without ⟦**⟧ and ending with a filter⟫: ⟦\\**⟧ is inserted before final filter to find all matching files of all subfolders.";
