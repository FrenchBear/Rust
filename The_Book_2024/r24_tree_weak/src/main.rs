// We want a Node to own its children, and we want to share that ownership with variables so we can access
// each Node in the tree directly. To do this, we define the Vec<T> items to be values of type Rc<Node>.
// We also want to modify which nodes are children of another node, so we have a RefCell<T> in children
// around the Vec<Rc<Node>>.
